        Little boxes on the hillside,
        Little boxes made of ticky tacky,
        Little boxes on the hillside,
        Little boxes all the same.
        There's a green one and a pink one
        And a blue one and a yellow one,
        And they're all made out of ticky tacky
        And they all look just the same
    </div>
